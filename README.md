<h1>Euwe - F\#<h1>

This is a tournament evaluation program applied in the
Ultimate tournament Marximal 2012 in Chemnitz.

## Rules
According to the game score (game points) each participating team achieves a certain
amount of match points. Every game yields constantly 16 match points. In case of 
a draw both teams gain 8 points. In case of a difference of 1 of game points
the winner gets 9 points and the looser gets 7 points. In case of a difference of 2
the distribution is 10-6 and so on until 15-1 is reached for a difference of 7 points.
Every greater difference yields 15-1, too.

Each new round is drawn by the rules of the [Swiss System][swiss].
